<h1> Interests</h1>
<p> I like solving problems and building things that have a positive impact on the world. And, Software Engineering is a great way to do both!!</p>
<p> Also I am always amused by the internals of computers. Begining with the compilation of the source code to binaries until their execution on the hardware. Maybe this is why I am interested in both performance and security aspects of system design.</p>
<p> I have a budding interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the domain of cognition.</p>
